Extension Icons

You need to add three icon files here:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These are used by Chrome for displaying the extension icon.

You can:
1. Create your own icons
2. Use a free icon generator
3. Use placeholder icons from https://placeholder.com/

For now, the extension will work without icons (Chrome will show a default puzzle piece icon).
